**This is how the file will look when we deal with the pull conflict before we push this to repo**

**THE FAKE CONFLICT LINE**

**This pull-merge-push from-to origin/Fake was done with WebStorm VCS GUI** 

**The prev commit/pull with  
   - [ ] Pull from the branch initially not fetched
   - [x] Pull with git pull origin Fake:AnotherLocalBranch
   was done through shell. This diff with this comment will be done trough WebStorm**
   
**Just another change to assure the remote 'Fake' branch is ahead of CheatSheet local branch in commits**
